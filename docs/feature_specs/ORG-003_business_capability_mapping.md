# Feature Specification: ORG-003 - Business Capability Mapping

## Overview
The Business Capability Mapping feature enables organizations to map their business functions and capabilities to compliance domains, providing crucial business context for compliance activities. This feature helps translate technical compliance requirements into business-relevant terms, allowing organizations to understand how regulations impact their core operations. The capability mapping serves as a key differentiator by contextualizing compliance within the organization's business model, enhancing decision-making and prioritization.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Capability model service
  - Capability-compliance mapping service
  - Business function database
  - API endpoints for capability management
  - Capability relationship engine
- **Frontend:**
  - Capability mapping UI
  - Visual capability mapper
  - Capability-compliance matrix
  - Capability editor
  - Relationship visualization

## Technical Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database for capability data storage
- Next.js for frontend rendering
- D3.js or similar for visualization components
- React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Tree data structure algorithms

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to map our business capabilities to compliance domains so that I can understand which business functions are affected by specific regulations.
- As an Operations Manager, I want to see how compliance requirements map to our business capabilities so that I can communicate impacts to department leaders.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to identify critical business capabilities affected by compliance gaps so that I can prioritize remediation efforts.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to link our business capabilities to assets so that I can understand which systems support regulated functions.
- As a CISO, I want a visual representation of business capabilities and their compliance status so that I can report to leadership in business terms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can create and manage a hierarchical business capability model
- The system provides industry-specific capability templates as starting points
- Business capabilities can be linked to compliance domains and controls
- Capabilities can be assigned criticality ratings
- Users can visualize the relationships between capabilities and compliance requirements
- The capability model integrates with the regulatory framework
- Users can import existing capability models in standard formats (CSV, Excel)
- The capability map is used to contextualize recommendations and reporting
- The model allows for custom capability attributes
- Changes to the capability model are tracked with version history

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Organizational Profile (ORG-001) for industry context
- Connects with Regulatory Questionnaire (ORG-002) to map to applicable regulations
- Feeds business context to AI Recommendation Engine (ARP-001)
- Links with Asset Inventory (ASM-001) to connect assets to business functions
- Capability criticality influences Risk Assessment (RSK-001)
- Provides business context for Contextual Recommendations (ARP-004)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test capability CRUD operations
  - Validate capability hierarchy logic
  - Test capability-compliance mapping functions
  - Verify import/export functionality
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test integration with regulatory framework
  - Verify data flow to AI recommendation engine
  - Test connection with asset inventory
- **User Testing:**
  - Evaluate ease of creating capability models
  - Assess clarity of capability-compliance visualization
  - Test usefulness of business context in decision-making

## Implementation Phases
1. **Initial Implementation (Sprint 3)**
   - Develop core capability model data structures
   - Implement basic CRUD operations for capabilities
   - Create simple capability hierarchy visualization
   - Implement basic capability-compliance mapping
   - Create industry templates for common capabilities

2. **Enhancements (Later Sprints - out of MVP scope)**
   - Add advanced visualization options
   - Implement capability maturity assessment
   - Create capability impact analysis
   - Add capability benchmarking
   - Implement process flow mapping

## UI/UX Design
- **Capability Management Interface**
  - Hierarchical tree view of capabilities
  - Drag-and-drop for organizing capabilities
  - Inline editing of capability details
  - Import/export buttons
  - Template selection for quick start
  
- **Capability-Compliance Matrix**
  - Grid showing capabilities vs. compliance domains
  - Heat map visualization of impact or coverage
  - Filtering by capability type or compliance domain
  - Drill-down for detailed compliance requirements

- **Capability Editor**
  - Form for editing capability details
  - Fields for capability name, description, criticality
  - Owner assignment dropdown
  - Compliance domain selector
  - Asset relationship manager
