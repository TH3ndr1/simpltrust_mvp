# Feature Specification: ARP-003 - Task Prioritization

## Overview
The Task Prioritization feature provides an intelligent and dynamic system for ordering remediation and implementation tasks based on a comprehensive set of factors including risk level, compliance deadlines, resource availability, task dependencies, business impact, and strategic importance. This feature ensures that the most critical and impactful tasks are addressed first, optimizing the allocation of limited resources and accelerating improvements in security and compliance posture. Task Prioritization goes beyond simple static priority levels by employing a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers multiple dimensions and automatically adapts to changing conditions, providing organizations with a constantly updated and optimized implementation roadmap.

  - API endpoints for prioritization
- **Frontend:**
  - Prioritization dashboard
  - Priority configuration interface
  - Factor weighting controls
  - Priority visualization components
  - Task queue management
  - Capacity planning tools
  - Priority override interface

## User Stories
- As a CISO, I want to ensure that tasks addressing the highest risk gaps are prioritized so that we reduce our most critical exposures first.
- As a Compliance Manager, I want to prioritize tasks with approaching regulatory deadlines so that we meet our compliance obligations on time.
- As an IT Manager, I want to see a prioritized task list for my team that accounts for our resource constraints so that we can efficiently allocate our limited staff.
- As a Security Analyst, I want the system to automatically reprioritize tasks when new high-risk issues are identified so that we can respond quickly to emerging threats.
- As a Control Owner, I want to influence the priority of tasks related to my controls so that I can ensure critical improvements get appropriate attention.
- As a Project Manager, I want to see task dependencies reflected in prioritization so that prerequisite tasks are completed before dependent ones.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to see prioritization that balances risk reduction with implementation effort so that we maximize our security ROI.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to apply different prioritization schemes for different compliance frameworks so that we can focus on our most important regulatory obligations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System calculates a priority score for each task based on multiple configurable factors
- Prioritization algorithm considers task dependencies to ensure logical implementation sequence
- Users can configure weightings for different prioritization factors
- System supports different prioritization schemes for different task types or categories
- Priority scores are recalculated automatically when relevant factors change
- Users can manually override priority for specific tasks when necessary
