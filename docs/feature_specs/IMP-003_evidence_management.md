# Feature Specification: IMP-003 Evidence Management

## Overview

The Evidence Management feature provides a centralized system for collecting, organizing, storing, and retrieving evidence of control implementation and compliance activities. This feature enables organizations to maintain a comprehensive repository of documentary evidence that supports their compliance status claims and demonstrates due diligence to auditors and regulators. By providing structured evidence management capabilities, the system helps reduce the time and effort required during audits while ensuring that all compliance claims are properly substantiated.

Evidence can include documents, screenshots, configuration files, policy statements, system logs, testing results, and other artifacts that demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of security controls. The feature includes capabilities for evidence collection, tagging, versioning, access control, and lifecycle management to ensure that evidence remains current, accessible, and relevant.

## Affected Components

## Technical Dependencies

- **Task Management (IMP-002)**: Evidence is often associated with task completion
- **Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004)**: Evidence demonstrates implementation of controls for specific assets
- **Gap Identification (GAP-001)**: Evidence may address identified gaps
- **Assessment Execution (ASP-002)**: Evidence is collected during assessments
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing evidence metadata
- **Object Storage System** (S3, Azure Blob, etc.): For storing evidence files
- **Elasticsearch**: For advanced evidence search capabilities
- **React**: For building the evidence management UI components
- **File Processing Libraries**: For handling various file formats and extraction of metadata

## User Stories

1. **As a Compliance Manager**, I want to upload and organize evidence of control implementations, so that I can easily retrieve it during audits and demonstrate compliance status.

2. **As an IT Administrator**, I want to attach implementation evidence directly to completed tasks, so that there is a clear record of what was done to address compliance requirements.

3. **As an Auditor**, I want to search for and review evidence by control framework, regulation, or specific requirement, so that I can efficiently verify compliance status.

4. **As a Security Analyst**, I want to validate that uploaded evidence actually supports the claimed control implementation, so that we can ensure our compliance posture is accurately represented.

5. **As a CISO**, I want to see a dashboard of evidence coverage across our control framework, so that I can identify areas where we lack proper documentation of our compliance efforts.

6. **As a Compliance Officer**, I want to receive notifications when evidence is approaching expiration, so that I can ensure it is renewed or updated to maintain continuous compliance.

7. **As a Risk Manager**, I want to link evidence to specific risk mitigation activities, so that I can demonstrate how our compliance activities are addressing identified risks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can upload, categorize, and tag evidence files in various formats (PDF, Word, Excel, images, logs, etc.)
2. Evidence can be linked to controls, requirements, tasks, gaps, assets, and other relevant entities
3. Evidence includes metadata such as collection date, source, expiration date, and approval status
4. The system supports version control for evidence, maintaining a history of changes
5. Users can search for evidence using multiple criteria, including content-based search where applicable
6. Evidence lifecycle management includes notifications for expiring evidence and automated archiving policies
7. Access controls limit who can view, upload, modify, or delete specific categories of evidence
8. Evidence dashboards show coverage metrics and identify areas lacking proper documentation
9. The system supports bulk upload and management of evidence for efficiency
10. Evidence validation workflows allow for review and approval of submitted evidence
11. Users can generate evidence reports by control, regulation, or other organizational dimensions

## Integration Points
