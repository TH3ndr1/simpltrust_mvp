# Feature Specification: REP-003 External Reporting

## Overview

The External Reporting feature enables organizations to create, manage, and distribute compliance and security reports tailored for external stakeholders such as regulators, auditors, customers, partners, and investors. This feature addresses the need to communicate security posture and compliance status to entities outside the organization while maintaining appropriate confidentiality, providing necessary context, and ensuring the information presented meets specific external requirements.

Unlike internal reporting, external reporting requires careful control over what information is shared, how it is presented, and with whom it is shared. This feature includes capabilities for sanitizing sensitive data, packaging evidence, creating audience-specific report views, tracking report distribution, and managing recipient access. It supports various external reporting scenarios including regulatory filings, audit evidence packages, customer security questionnaires, partner security assessments, and investor/board communications.

The External Reporting feature builds upon the core Reporting Module (REP-001) but adds specialized capabilities for external communication while ensuring that sensitive information remains protected through granular access controls and content filtering.

## User Stories

1. **As a Compliance Manager**, I want to generate audit-ready compliance reports with appropriate evidence, so that I can efficiently provide auditors with the information they need while limiting access to sensitive data.

2. **As a Security Officer**, I want to create customer-facing security reports that demonstrate our security posture, so that I can respond to customer security assessments without revealing sensitive details.

3. **As a Governance Lead**, I want to package regulatory compliance reports with supporting evidence, so that I can demonstrate compliance to regulators during examinations.

4. **As a Vendor Manager**, I want to generate third-party security questionnaire responses with appropriate documentation, so that I can efficiently respond to customer and partner security reviews.

5. **As a CISO**, I want to create board-level security briefing documents, so that I can communicate security status to board members without overwhelming them with technical details.

6. **As a Customer Success Manager**, I want to provide customers with self-service access to compliance certifications and security reports, so that they can verify our security posture without requiring manual responses.

7. **As an Audit Coordinator**, I want to track which reports and evidence have been shared with external auditors, so that I can maintain a complete audit trail of information disclosure.

8. **As a Risk Manager**, I want to create sanitized risk reports for partners and investors, so that I can communicate risk status without revealing sensitive vulnerabilities.
