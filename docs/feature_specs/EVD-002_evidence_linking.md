# Feature Specification: EVD-002 Evidence Linking

## Overview

The Evidence Linking feature enables organizations to create, manage, and navigate meaningful relationships between evidence items and other entities in the SimpleTrust platform. This feature builds upon the Evidence Storage foundation to provide context and traceability for compliance documentation. By establishing explicit connections between evidence and elements such as controls, requirements, risks, gaps, and implementation tasks, Evidence Linking transforms a simple document repository into a rich, interconnected compliance knowledge base.

Evidence Linking addresses a critical challenge in compliance management: understanding how specific evidence demonstrates adherence to multiple requirements across different frameworks. Without proper linking, organizations often struggle to identify which documentation satisfies which requirements, leading to redundant evidence collection and gaps in audit preparation. This feature enables a single piece of evidence to be associated with multiple controls or frameworks, showcasing how it supports various compliance objectives simultaneously.

The feature supports both manual and automated evidence linking, with capabilities for bulk operations, inheritance of links through hierarchical relationships, and visualization of evidence coverage. With Evidence Linking, auditors and compliance teams can efficiently navigate from requirements to supporting evidence and vice versa, significantly streamlining compliance verification and reporting processes.
