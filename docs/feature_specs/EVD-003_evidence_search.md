# Feature Specification: EVD-003 Evidence Search

## Overview

The Evidence Search feature enables comprehensive, efficient discovery of compliance and security evidence across the SimpleTrust platform. Building upon the Evidence Storage and Evidence Linking features, this advanced search capability provides users with powerful ways to locate, filter, and retrieve evidence based on multiple dimensions including metadata, content, relationships, and temporal attributes.

Evidence Search addresses a critical challenge in compliance management: efficiently locating specific evidence during audits, assessments, or investigations. As organizations accumulate substantial volumes of compliance documentation, the ability to quickly pinpoint relevant evidence becomes crucial for operational efficiency. Without effective search capabilities, valuable time is wasted manually browsing through evidence repositories, potentially missing critical documentation.

This feature implements a multi-layered search approach, combining metadata searching, full-text content indexing, relationship-based discovery, and advanced filtering capabilities. It supports both simple keyword searches for quick lookups and complex, structured queries for precise evidence retrieval. The search results are presented with contextual information, highlighting relationships to other entities and providing instant evidence previews.

Evidence Search transforms how users interact with the evidence repository, significantly reducing the time required to locate documentation and enabling audit-ready access to compliance evidence. For organizations managing extensive compliance programs across multiple regulations, this capability is essential for maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.
