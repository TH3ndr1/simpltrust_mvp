# Feature Specification: RSK-001 - Risk Assessment

## Overview
The Risk Assessment feature enables organizations to evaluate and quantify the risks associated with their assets and compliance gaps. This feature combines asset criticality, threat likelihood, vulnerability assessment, and potential impact to calculate risk scores for assets and control gaps. By providing a structured risk assessment framework, the system helps organizations prioritize their security efforts based on actual risk rather than simply following a compliance checklist. This risk-based approach ensures that limited security resources are allocated to addressing the most significant risks first.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Risk calculation engine
  - Risk factor management service
  - Risk assessment service
  - Risk scoring service
  - API endpoints for risk management
- **Frontend:**
  - Risk assessment interface
  - Risk factor configuration UI
  - Risk matrix visualization
  - Risk scoring dashboard
  - Risk assessment wizard

## Technical Dependencies
- Asset Inventory (ASM-001)
- Asset Criticality (ASM-003)
- Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004)
- Gap Identification (GAP-001)
- PostgreSQL database for risk data storage
- Next.js for frontend rendering
- React for UI components

## User Stories
- As a Risk Manager, I want to assess risks based on asset criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts so that I can quantify our overall risk posture.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to incorporate compliance gaps into risk assessments so that I can prioritize remediation based on actual risk.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to customize risk calculation factors so that risk assessments reflect our organization's specific concerns and environment.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to see which assets pose the highest risk so that I can focus security hardening efforts appropriately.
- As a CISO, I want to generate risk reports that show risk levels by asset, business function, or compliance domain so that I can effectively communicate risk to leadership.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System calculates risk scores based on multiple factors (criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts)
- Users can customize risk factors and their weights
- Risk assessment considers compliance gaps identified in assessments
- System supports both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methodologies
- Users can conduct risk assessments at different levels (asset, asset group, organization-wide)
- Risk scores are visualized through heat maps and risk matrices
- System tracks risk trends over time
- Users can document risk treatment decisions (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid)
- Risk assessments include confidence levels to indicate uncertainty
- System provides risk prioritization recommendations
- Risk reports can be generated and exported

## Integration Points
- Builds upon Asset Inventory (ASM-001) and Asset Criticality (ASM-003)
- Uses Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) to incorporate control status
