# Feature Specification: REP-004 - Advanced Gap Reporting (Post-MVP)

## Overview
The Advanced Gap Reporting feature extends the core gap reporting capabilities (GAP-003) with comprehensive, customizable reporting tools designed for diverse stakeholder needs. While the GAP-003 feature provides essential gap visibility for the MVP, this post-MVP feature transforms gap data into sophisticated reports with advanced visualization options, scheduling capabilities, extensive distribution methods, and integration with the broader reporting ecosystem. Advanced Gap Reporting enables organizations to generate executive dashboards, detailed technical reports, regulatory compliance documentation, and trend analyses with the depth and customization needed for stakeholder-specific communication. This feature serves as a bridge between the technical details of security gaps and executive decision-making, providing context-rich reports that facilitate communication across different organizational levels and with external parties.

## Relationship to Core Gap Reporting (GAP-003)

This Advanced Gap Reporting feature builds upon the foundation established by the core Gap Reporting (GAP-003) feature in the MVP. While GAP-003 provides essential gap visibility through basic dashboard views, filtering, and simple exports, this post-MVP feature significantly extends those capabilities with:

1. **Advanced Customization**: Custom report builder with drag-and-drop functionality versus predefined reports in GAP-003
2. **Sophisticated Analytics**: Advanced trend analysis and predictive modeling versus basic trend visualization in GAP-003
3. **Comprehensive Distribution**: Scheduled reports with configurable distribution lists versus on-demand exports in GAP-003
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic, interactive visualizations with drill-down versus static charts in GAP-003
5. **Collaboration Features**: Comments, annotations, and sharing controls not available in GAP-003
6. **Enterprise Reporting**: Cross-business unit comparison and advanced filtering not available in GAP-003

This feature represents a natural evolution of the reporting capabilities, moving from the essential gap visibility provided in the MVP to comprehensive reporting capabilities suitable for complex enterprise environments.
