# Feature Specification: ARP-002 - Task Generation

## Overview
The Task Generation feature transforms high-level recommendations, compliance gaps, and control implementation needs into concrete, actionable tasks that can be assigned, tracked, and completed. This feature bridges the gap between identification of issues and their resolution by breaking down complex compliance requirements into manageable work units with clear owners, deadlines, and success criteria. Task Generation automatically creates tasks based on AI recommendations, gap remediation needs, and control implementation requirements, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks in the compliance process. The system intelligently determines appropriate task types, suggested assignees, and reasonable timelines based on organizational context, task dependencies, and resource availability.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Task generation service
  - Task template engine
  - Task dependency analyzer
  - Effort estimation service
  - Task assignment suggestion engine
  - Task API endpoints
- **Frontend:**
  - Task creation interface
  - Task template management
  - Task generation configuration
  - Bulk task generation tools
  - Task preview and editing components
  - Task dependency visualization

## Technical Dependencies
- AI Recommendation Engine (ARP-001) for recommendation data
- Gap Identification (GAP-001) for gap data
- Gap Prioritization (GAP-002) for priority information
- Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) for control context
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Next.js for frontend rendering
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Timeline visualization library
- Drag-and-drop library for task management

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Manager, I want the system to automatically generate tasks from compliance gaps so that I can ensure all gaps are addressed efficiently.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to convert AI recommendations into assignable tasks so that my team can implement the recommended controls.
- As a Project Manager, I want to see dependencies between tasks so that I can sequence them properly.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to receive clearly defined tasks for control implementation so that I know exactly what to do.
- As a CISO, I want to see an overview of all generated tasks by status and priority so that I can monitor remediation progress.
- As a Control Owner, I want to customize task templates for my domain so that generated tasks follow our standard procedures.
- As a Task Assignee, I want task descriptions to include all necessary information to complete the work so that I don't have to search for additional context.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to manually create tasks and link them to gaps or controls so that I can supplement automatically generated tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System automatically generates tasks from AI recommendations, gaps, and control implementation needs
- Tasks include title, description, priority, estimated effort, due date, and suggested assignee
- Tasks are linked to their source (recommendation, gap, or control)
- System supports task dependencies and sequencing
- Users can modify task templates for different task types
- Tasks can be generated individually or in bulk
- Generated tasks can be previewed and edited before finalization
- System supports recurring task generation for periodic compliance activities
- Task due dates are calculated based on priority and estimated effort
- Tasks include acceptance criteria for completion
- System detects duplicate or overlapping tasks and offers to consolidate them
- Tasks capture and maintain context from their source

## Integration Points
- Receives recommendation data from AI Recommendation Engine (ARP-001)
- Uses gap data from Gap Identification (GAP-001)
- Incorporates priority from Gap Prioritization (GAP-002)
- Leverages control data from Control Framework Model (UCF-001)
