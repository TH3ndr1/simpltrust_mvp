# Feature Specification: IMP-001 - Implementation Dashboard

## Overview
The Implementation Dashboard provides a comprehensive, real-time view of an organization's compliance and security implementation progress. This centralized visualization hub transforms complex implementation data into actionable insights through interactive charts, status indicators, and progress metrics. The dashboard enables stakeholders at all levels to monitor implementation activities, track progress toward compliance goals, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and prioritization. With customizable views for different roles and the ability to drill down from high-level summaries to detailed task information, the Implementation Dashboard serves as the primary interface for tracking and managing the organization's journey toward improved security and compliance posture.

- As a Compliance Manager, I want to track implementation progress by regulatory framework so that I can ensure we're meeting our compliance obligations.
- As a Project Manager, I want to monitor task completion rates and resource utilization so that I can identify and address bottlenecks.
- As a Team Lead, I want to view my team's assigned tasks and progress so that I can manage workload and report on our contributions.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to see implementation trends over time so that I can identify patterns and forecast future needs.
- As a Control Owner, I want to track the implementation status of my assigned controls so that I can ensure they're properly implemented and tested.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to see remediation progress for high-risk gaps so that I can ensure our most critical exposures are being addressed.
- As an IT Director, I want to create custom dashboard views for different stakeholders so that everyone sees the information most relevant to their role.
