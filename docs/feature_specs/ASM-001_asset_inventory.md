# Feature Specification: ASM-001 - Asset Inventory

## Overview
The Asset Inventory feature enables organizations to create and maintain a comprehensive inventory of their technology and information assets. This foundational capability allows organizations to document what assets they have, where they are located, who owns them, and how they relate to one another. The asset inventory serves as the foundation for asset-based compliance activities, including risk assessment, control mapping, and gap analysis. By establishing a clear understanding of the asset landscape, the system can provide contextually relevant compliance guidance and prioritize security efforts based on business impact.

The system provides a flexible, categorized view of assets with criticality ratings and enables linking assets to compliance controls and business capabilities, forming a critical foundation for compliance and risk management by establishing what needs to be protected, its importance to the business, and how it relates to regulatory requirements.

## User Stories
- As an IT Administrator, I want to create and maintain an inventory of our technology assets so that I know what systems we have and need to protect.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to categorize assets by type and function so that I can understand which compliance requirements apply to them.
- As an Operations Manager, I want to assign ownership and responsibility for assets so that accountability is clear.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to establish relationships between assets so that I understand dependencies and potential cascading impacts.
- As a CISO, I want to import existing asset data from other systems so that I don't have to manually recreate our inventory.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can create, view, update, and delete asset records
- System supports multiple asset types (hardware, software, data, services)
- Assets can be categorized and tagged with custom attributes
- Assets can be linked to show relationships and dependencies
- Users can import assets from CSV/Excel files
- Assets can be exported in standard formats
- System supports bulk operations on multiple assets
- Asset search functionality supports advanced filtering
- Users can assign ownership and custodianship to assets
- System maintains version history of asset changes
- Assets can be organized hierarchically (e.g., systems containing components)

## Integration Points
- Connects with Business Capability Mapping (ORG-003) to link assets to business functions
- Provides foundation for Asset Categorization (ASM-002) and Asset Criticality (ASM-003)
- Enables Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) by providing the asset catalog
- Supports Risk Assessment (RSK-001) by defining what assets need risk evaluation
- Informs Assessment Templates (ASP-001) for asset-specific assessments
- Provides context for AI Recommendation Engine (ARP-001)
