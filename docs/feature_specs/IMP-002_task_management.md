# Feature Specification: IMP-002 - Task Management

## Overview
The Task Management feature provides a robust system for tracking, managing, and reporting on security and compliance implementation tasks. It serves as the operational foundation for translating compliance requirements and gap remediation needs into actionable work items that can be assigned, tracked to completion, and evidenced. The Task Management system enables organizations to efficiently allocate resources, track progress, collect implementation evidence, and manage dependencies across complex compliance projects. By offering flexible views, automated status updates, and integration with existing workflow tools, Task Management bridges the gap between strategic compliance goals and tactical execution, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks during implementation.

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Manager, I want to assign tasks to team members so that responsibilities are clearly defined and progress can be tracked.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to update task status and add comments so that stakeholders have visibility into implementation progress.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to attach evidence to completed tasks so that we can demonstrate control implementation during audits.
- As a Team Lead, I want to view all tasks assigned to my team so that I can manage workload and ensure deadlines are met.
- As a Task Assignee, I want to receive notifications about new assignments and approaching deadlines so that I can prioritize my work effectively.
- As a Project Manager, I want to create and manage task dependencies so that work is sequenced properly.
- As a Control Owner, I want to link tasks to specific controls so that I can track implementation status for my areas of responsibility.
- As a CISO, I want to see task completion metrics by framework and team so that I can monitor implementation progress at a high level.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to export task data for reporting purposes so that I can provide updates to external auditors or management.
