# Feature Specification: GAP-001 - Gap Identification

## Overview
The Gap Identification feature enables organizations to systematically identify, document, and track gaps in their compliance and security programs. By analyzing assessment results, control implementations, and regulatory requirements, the system identifies where an organization falls short of meeting its compliance obligations or security objectives. This feature provides the critical link between assessment findings and remediation activities, transforming assessment data into actionable insights. Gap identification is essential for prioritizing remediation efforts, allocating resources effectively, and tracking progress toward closing compliance and security gaps.

  - Gap filtering and search interface
  - Gap classification interface
  - Gap export functionality
  - Gap visualization components

## Technical Dependencies
- Assessment Execution (ASP-002) for assessment results
- Control Framework Model (UCF-001) for compliance requirements
- Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) for control implementation status

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to identify gaps between our implemented controls and regulatory requirements so that I can prioritize remediation efforts.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to view gaps by severity and risk level so that I can focus on the most critical issues first.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to see gaps related to specific systems or assets so that I can plan targeted remediation activities.
- As a Department Head, I want to view compliance gaps in my department so that I can allocate resources to address them.
- As a CISO, I want to track gap closure progress over time so that I can report on compliance improvement to executive leadership.
- As an Auditor, I want to export gap reports so that I can include them in audit documentation.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to link gaps to specific risks so that I can better understand the risk implications of compliance gaps.
