# Feature Specification: UCF-004 - Framework Visualization

## Overview
The Framework Visualization feature provides interactive, visual representations of the unified control framework, enabling users to understand complex relationships between controls, regulations, and business elements at a glance. This feature transforms abstract compliance concepts into intuitive visual formats, supporting decision-making and communication with stakeholders. Through multiple visualization types, users can explore the control framework from different perspectives, identify patterns, and gain insights that would be difficult to discern from tabular data alone.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Visualization data preparation service
  - Framework relationship analysis service
  - Graph construction service
  - Data export service
  - API endpoints for visualization data
- **Frontend:**
  - Interactive visualization canvas
  - Visualization type selector
  - Filtering and highlighting tools
  - Detail panel for selected elements
  - Export and sharing functionality

## Technical Dependencies
- D3.js or similar visualization library
- Three.js for 3D visualizations (if applicable)
- Canvas/SVG rendering capabilities
- Control Framework Model (UCF-001)
- Regulatory Mapping (UCF-002)
- Control Consolidation (UCF-003)
- Next.js for frontend rendering
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Data transformation libraries

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to visualize the relationships between our controls and regulations so that I can better understand our compliance coverage.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to see a heat map of control implementation status so that I can quickly identify areas needing attention.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to visualize the relationships between assets and controls so that I understand which systems implement which controls.
- As a CISO, I want to generate visual reports of our compliance framework so that I can effectively communicate with executive leadership.
- As a Consultant, I want to switch between different visualization types so that I can analyze the framework from multiple perspectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System provides at least three visualization types (network graph, treemap, matrix)
- Visualizations are interactive with zoom, pan, and selection capabilities
- Users can filter visualizations by domain, regulation, or status
- Selecting elements shows detailed information in a side panel
- Visualizations dynamically update based on framework changes
- Users can customize color schemes and display options
- Visualizations can be exported as images or embedded in reports
- System provides legend and context for interpreting visualizations
- Visualizations work across different screen sizes with responsive design
- Performance remains acceptable when visualizing large frameworks (>500 controls)

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Control Framework Model (UCF-001) for control hierarchy data
- Uses Regulatory Mapping (UCF-002) to show regulation relationships
- Incorporates Control Consolidation (UCF-003) to show consolidated views
- Connects with Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) to visualize asset relationships
- Links with Gap Identification (GAP-001) to highlight compliance gaps
- Provides visuals for Risk Visualization (RSK-002) when related to controls

## Testing Strategy

  - Test data preparation functions
  - Validate graph construction algorithms
  - Test visualization configuration options
  - Verify data transformations
- **Integration Tests:**

  - Filter controls by domain, regulation, status
  - Display options (color scheme, layout)
  - Legend explaining visual elements
  - Export and sharing buttons

- **Detail Panel**
  - Contextual information for selected elements
  - Related items and dependencies
  - Implementation status and metrics
  - Direct links to edit relevant data
  - Historical view of changes
