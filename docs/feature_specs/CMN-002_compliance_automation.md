# Feature Specification: CMN-002 Compliance Automation

## Overview

The Compliance Automation feature provides organizations with the ability to automate compliance verification, remediation, and maintenance tasks that would traditionally require manual intervention. This feature transforms labor-intensive compliance activities into programmatic, repeatable, and reliable processes that operate continuously and consistently.

Compliance Automation addresses a key challenge in modern security and compliance programs: the significant manual effort required to verify, implement, and maintain controls across increasingly complex technology environments. Manual compliance activities are not only resource-intensive but also prone to human error, inconsistency, and gaps in coverage. By systematically automating these activities, organizations can achieve higher levels of compliance assurance with reduced effort, allowing security and compliance teams to focus on higher-value strategic activities.

The feature leverages integrations with various systems and tools to collect compliance data, verify control implementations, remediate non-compliance, and document evidence automatically. It supports both automated checks (verification that controls are properly implemented) and automated remediation (correcting non-compliant configurations or implementations). The automation capabilities span across infrastructure, application, data, and identity domains, addressing technical controls that are amenable to programmatic verification and enforcement.

Compliance Automation serves as a core capability within the Continuous Compliance epic, working in conjunction with Compliance Monitoring to maintain an ongoing state of compliance through technology rather than periodic manual efforts.
