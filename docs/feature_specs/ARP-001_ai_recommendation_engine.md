# Feature Specification: ARP-001 - AI Recommendation Engine

## Overview
The AI Recommendation Engine is a core intelligence feature that analyzes compliance gaps, control frameworks, asset data, and risk assessments to generate targeted, actionable recommendations for improving security and compliance posture. By leveraging machine learning and pattern recognition, the system provides smart, context-aware suggestions that help organizations efficiently address compliance gaps, optimize control implementation, and reduce risk. This feature transforms SimpleTrust from a passive compliance tracking system into an active advisor that guides users through the complex process of remediation and continuous improvement, providing expert-level guidance that adapts to each organization's unique environment and compliance requirements.
