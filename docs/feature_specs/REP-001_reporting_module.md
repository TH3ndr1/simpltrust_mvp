# Feature Specification: REP-001 Reporting Module

## Overview

The Reporting Module serves as the core reporting engine for the SimpleTrust platform, providing a comprehensive framework for generating, customizing, managing, and distributing reports across all aspects of compliance and security management. This feature enables organizations to transform raw compliance and security data into meaningful, actionable reports that support decision-making, demonstrate compliance status, and communicate with stakeholders.

The module includes capabilities for building report templates, scheduling automated report generation, configuring visualization preferences, exporting in multiple formats, and distributing reports to stakeholders. As a foundational reporting component, this module provides the underlying architecture for specialized reporting features such as Executive Dashboards (REP-002), External Reporting (REP-003), and Gap Reporting (REP-004).

By centralizing reporting capabilities, the module ensures consistency in reporting methodology, appearance, and data processing while allowing for the flexibility needed to address diverse reporting requirements across different compliance domains, business functions, and stakeholder groups.
