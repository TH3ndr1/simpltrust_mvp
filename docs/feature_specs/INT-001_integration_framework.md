# Feature Specification: INT-001 Integration Framework

## Overview

The Integration Framework provides a standardized, extensible architecture for connecting SimpleTrust with external systems, tools, and data sources. This feature enables the platform to exchange data with security tools, IT service management systems, cloud providers, directory services, and other enterprise applications, creating a unified compliance and security management ecosystem.

This framework addresses a fundamental challenge in compliance and security management: the need to gather, correlate, and validate information from diverse systems across an organization's technology landscape. Without robust integration capabilities, organizations must manually collect and reconcile data across system boundaries, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and inefficiencies in compliance management.

The Integration Framework implements a modular connector architecture with standardized interfaces, authentication methods, and data transformation capabilities. It supports various integration patterns including API-based connections, webhook event processing, scheduled data synchronization, and file-based imports. The framework provides both pre-built connectors for common enterprise systems and a software development kit (SDK) for creating custom connectors to meet organization-specific needs.

By serving as the foundation for system interconnectivity, the Integration Framework enables key capabilities throughout the SimpleTrust platform, including automated evidence collection, continuous control monitoring, and comprehensive security posture visibility. It transforms SimpleTrust from a standalone compliance management tool into a central hub for organization-wide security and compliance orchestration.
