# Feature Specification: GAP-003 - Gap Reporting

## Overview
The Gap Reporting feature enables organizations to generate targeted reports on compliance and security gaps to support remediation efforts and provide visibility into compliance status. This feature focuses on the core reporting capabilities specifically related to gap identification and prioritization, transforming gap data into actionable insights through visualization and basic reporting tools. Gap reporting is essential for communicating compliance status to various stakeholders and tracking remediation progress over time. By providing simplified views of gap data with appropriate context, the feature helps teams understand what needs to be addressed, in what order, and why - making it easier to take the right actions to improve compliance status.

## Affected Components

  - Gap visualization components
  - Export controls
  - Gap report configuration

## Technical Dependencies
- Gap Identification (GAP-001)
- Gap Prioritization (GAP-002)
- Risk Assessment (RSK-001) for risk context (optional)

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to view a summary of compliance gaps by framework so that I can understand our overall compliance status.
- As an IT Manager, I want to see gaps related to my team's responsibilities so that I can focus remediation efforts appropriately.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to see gaps prioritized by risk level so that I can address the most critical issues first.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to export a list of gaps with their details so that I can work on remediation planning.
- As a Team Lead, I want to track gap remediation progress so that I can report on improvements over time.
- As a Compliance Manager, I want to filter gaps by status, priority, and control domain so that I can focus on specific areas of concern.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System provides a gap summary dashboard with key metrics and visualizations
- Users can filter and sort gaps by various criteria (framework, status, priority, etc.)
- Visualizations include gap distribution by priority, status, and control domain
- Users can view trend data showing gap status changes over time (limited to key metrics)
- System allows exporting gap data in basic formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Gap reports include essential context such as control requirements and prioritization
- Users can save common filter configurations for quick access
- System provides a printable gap summary report for stakeholder communications
- Gap reports maintain consistent visual design with the rest of the platform
- Dashboards automatically refresh when gap data changes

## Integration Points
- Uses gap data from Gap Identification (GAP-001)

## Future Integration with Advanced Reporting
The Gap Reporting feature provides essential gap visibility as part of the MVP. In post-MVP development, this feature will integrate with the comprehensive Reporting Module (REP-001) and more advanced Gap Reporting capabilities (REP-004) to provide:

- Advanced customization of gap reports
- Scheduled report generation and distribution
- More sophisticated trend analysis and forecasting
- Integration with executive dashboards
- External report generation for auditors and regulators
- Custom report templates for different stakeholders

This phased approach ensures that critical gap visibility is available in the MVP while allowing for more advanced reporting capabilities in future releases.
