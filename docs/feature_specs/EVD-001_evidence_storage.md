# Feature Specification: EVD-001 Evidence Storage

## Overview

The Evidence Storage feature provides a centralized, secure system for collecting, organizing, storing, and retrieving evidence of compliance and security control implementation. This feature is essential for demonstrating adherence to regulatory requirements during audits and assessments. It allows organizations to maintain a complete, accessible repository of all compliance-related documentation, implementation proof, and control evidence.

Evidence Storage addresses several critical compliance challenges: ensuring evidence is properly organized, maintaining version history, establishing secure access controls, and facilitating efficient retrieval during audits or assessments. The feature supports various evidence types including documents, screenshots, logs, configuration files, and attestations, with appropriate metadata to establish context and relevance.

By maintaining a structured evidence repository, organizations can significantly reduce the time and effort required for audit preparation, ensure consistent evidence quality, and maintain a continuous state of audit readiness. The Evidence Storage feature forms the foundation of the Documentation & Evidence epic, enabling subsequent features like Evidence Linking and Evidence Search.

## User Stories

1. **As a Compliance Manager**, I want to upload and store implementation evidence for various controls, so that I can demonstrate compliance during audits.

2. **As a Security Analyst**, I want to attach configuration screenshots and logs as evidence, so that I can document security control implementation.

3. **As an IT Administrator**, I want to organize evidence into logical collections by control or regulation, so that retrieving documentation during audits is efficient.

4. **As an Auditor**, I want to view all evidence related to specific controls, so that I can verify implementation without having to request additional documentation.

5. **As a Compliance Officer**, I want to track when evidence was last updated, so that I can ensure documentation remains current and valid.

6. **As a Security Director**, I want to restrict access to sensitive evidence based on roles, so that confidential implementation details remain secure.

7. **As a Compliance Analyst**, I want to replace outdated evidence with updated versions while maintaining history, so that I can show progression of control implementation.

8. **As a Project Manager**, I want to upload multiple evidence files in a batch, so that I can efficiently document completed implementation work.

9. **As a CISO**, I want to see evidence coverage metrics across our control framework, so that I can identify areas lacking proper documentation.

10. **As a Risk Manager**, I want to add context and notes to evidence, so that reviewers understand its relevance and importance.
