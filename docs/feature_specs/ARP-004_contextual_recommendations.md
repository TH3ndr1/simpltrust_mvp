# Feature Specification: ARP-004 - Contextual Recommendations

## Overview
The Contextual Recommendations feature enhances the AI Recommendation Engine by delivering intelligent, context-aware guidance at the point of need throughout the compliance and security management process. Unlike the general recommendation engine which focuses on organization-wide improvements, Contextual Recommendations provides targeted advice, best practices, and implementation guidance based on the user's current activity, role, and the specific resource they're working with (e.g., a particular control, gap, task, or asset). This capability transforms SimpleTrust into an intelligent assistant that helps users make better decisions in real-time by surfacing relevant information, similar cases, applicable standards, and expert knowledge precisely when needed, improving productivity and compliance outcomes while accelerating user learning.

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to see relevant standards and best practices when I'm reviewing a control so that I can ensure it meets industry requirements.
- As an IT Administrator, I want context-specific implementation guidance when I'm working on a task so that I can complete it effectively without extensive research.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to see similar cases and their resolution when analyzing a gap so that I can learn from past experiences.
- As a Risk Manager, I want contextual recommendations for risk assessment when I'm evaluating a specific asset so that I can make consistent and thorough assessments.
- As a CISO, I want to see relevant metrics and benchmarks when reviewing a dashboard so that I can understand our performance in context.
- As a Control Owner, I want to receive suggestions for evidence collection when documenting control implementation so that I can provide comprehensive documentation.
- As a Compliance Manager, I want contextual guidance about regulatory requirements when mapping controls to frameworks so that I ensure accurate compliance coverage.
- As a New User, I want contextual help and tutorials as I navigate the system so that I can learn how to use it effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recommendations are relevant to the specific resource being viewed or edited
- Content is tailored to the user's role and permissions
- Recommendations appear in appropriate locations within the interface without disrupting workflow
- Users can dismiss, save, or act on recommendations directly
- System learns from user interactions to improve future recommendations
- Contextual information includes references to applicable standards and best practices
- Guidance is actionable and specific enough to be immediately useful
- System provides both short tips and access to more detailed information when needed
