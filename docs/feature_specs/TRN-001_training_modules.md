# Feature Specification: TRN-001 Training Modules

## Overview

The Training Modules feature provides a comprehensive learning framework integrated directly into the SimpleTrust platform, enabling organizations to build, deliver, and track compliance and security awareness training. This feature transforms SimpleTrust from a compliance management tool into a complete solution that not only identifies gaps and recommends actions but also educates employees on proper implementation of controls and compliance requirements.

Training Modules addresses a critical challenge in compliance and security management: ensuring that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities and have the knowledge required to implement and maintain controls effectively. Without proper training, even the best-designed compliance programs often fail due to human error, misunderstanding, or lack of awareness. By integrating training directly into the compliance platform, this feature creates a continuous feedback loop between gap identification, remediation, and education.

The feature supports various learning formats including interactive lessons, video content, quizzes, and practical exercises. It allows for role-based training assignments, tracking of completion and comprehension, and correlation between training activities and compliance improvements. Training content can be linked directly to specific controls, regulations, or identified gaps, creating a contextual learning experience that emphasizes practical application rather than abstract concepts.

Training Modules serves as the foundation for developing a strong security culture within organizations, transforming compliance from a checkbox exercise into an integrated part of organizational operations through continuous education and awareness.
