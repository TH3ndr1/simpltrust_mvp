# Feature Specification: CMN-001 Compliance Monitoring

## Overview

The Compliance Monitoring feature provides continuous visibility into an organization's compliance posture by monitoring, measuring, and reporting on the status of security controls and regulatory requirements over time. This feature transforms compliance from a periodic assessment activity into an ongoing operational process, enabling real-time awareness of compliance deviations and timely remediation of issues.

Compliance Monitoring addresses a critical challenge in modern security and compliance management: maintaining continuous adherence to requirements in environments that undergo constant change. Traditional point-in-time assessments create compliance visibility gaps, often allowing issues to persist undetected between formal evaluations. By implementing automated monitoring and tracking mechanisms, this feature provides timely insights into control effectiveness, configuration drift, and emerging compliance gaps.

The feature collects and analyzes data from multiple sources including implementation evidence, automated control checks, system integrations, and manual attestations. It establishes baseline compliance states, tracks deviations, sends alerts on significant changes, and provides trend analysis to identify patterns in compliance status. This comprehensive monitoring approach enables proactive compliance management and supports the concept of continuous compliance as a cornerstone of effective governance, risk, and compliance programs.

Compliance Monitoring serves as the foundation for the Continuous Compliance epic, providing the real-time visibility needed to maintain ongoing adherence to security and regulatory requirements while reducing the manual effort traditionally associated with compliance verification.
