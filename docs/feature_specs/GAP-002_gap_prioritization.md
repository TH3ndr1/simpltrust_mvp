# Feature Specification: GAP-002 - Gap Prioritization

## Overview
The Gap Prioritization feature enables organizations to systematically rank and prioritize identified compliance and security gaps based on multiple dimensions including risk level, regulatory impact, implementation effort, cost, and business context. This feature helps organizations make informed decisions about which gaps to address first, optimizing the allocation of limited resources to achieve the greatest risk reduction and compliance improvement. By providing structured prioritization frameworks and customizable scoring methods, the system enables organizations to move beyond ad-hoc or purely severity-based approaches to a more nuanced, business-aligned prioritization strategy that considers both compliance requirements and operational realities.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Prioritization engine
  - Scoring algorithm service
  - Customizable criteria service
  - Prioritization scheme management
  - Integration with risk data
  - API endpoints for prioritization
- **Frontend:**
  - Prioritization dashboard
  - Prioritization configuration interface
  - Scoring matrix visualization
  - Priority queue management
  - Prioritization reporting
  - Multi-dimensional gap visualization

## Technical Dependencies
- Gap Identification (GAP-001)
- Risk Assessment (RSK-001) for risk-based prioritization
- Asset Criticality (ASM-003) for impact assessment

## User Stories
- As a CISO, I want to prioritize gaps based on risk level and regulatory impact so that I can focus resources on the most critical compliance issues first.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to configure prioritization criteria specific to each regulatory framework so that prioritization reflects different compliance requirements.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to adjust gap priorities based on emerging threats so that our remediation efforts address evolving risk landscapes.
- As an IT Manager, I want to balance priority scores with implementation effort so that I can create realistic remediation plans.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to see gaps prioritized by business impact so that remediation aligns with business objectives.
- As a Department Head, I want to view prioritized gaps for my department so that I can allocate resources effectively.
- As a Financial Officer, I want to incorporate cost considerations into gap prioritization so that we optimize our compliance budget.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System automatically calculates priority scores based on configurable criteria
- Users can customize prioritization schemes with different weights and factors
- System supports multi-dimensional prioritization (risk, compliance, effort, cost, etc.)
- Priority scores update when underlying factors change (risk scores, asset criticality, etc.)
- System provides visualizations of prioritized gaps across different dimensions
- Users can manually override priority scores with justification
- System maintains history of priority changes
- Prioritization schemes can be framework-specific or organization-wide
- System allows bulk prioritization of related gaps
