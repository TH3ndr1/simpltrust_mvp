# Feature Specification: RSK-002 - Risk Visualization

## Overview
The Risk Visualization feature transforms complex risk assessment data into intuitive, interactive visual representations. It enables stakeholders at all levels to understand the organization's risk posture through customizable dashboards, heat maps, risk matrices, and trend charts. By visualizing risk data across different dimensions (assets, controls, compliance frameworks), the feature helps decision-makers quickly identify critical risk areas, track progress in risk reduction, and communicate risk effectively across the organization. This visualization capability bridges the gap between technical risk data and business decision-making.

## Affected Components

## User Stories
- As a CISO, I want to see a high-level dashboard of organizational risk posture so that I can report to the board and executive team effectively.
- As a Risk Manager, I want to view risk trends over time so that I can assess the effectiveness of our risk management program.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to visualize risk by compliance framework so that I can identify which regulatory areas have the highest risk exposure.
- As an IT Administrator, I want to see risk heat maps by asset type and business function so that I can focus my team's efforts appropriately.
- As a Security Analyst, I want to create custom risk visualizations so that I can analyze risk from different perspectives.
- As a Department Head, I want to see risk data specific to my department's assets so that I can manage risks within my area of responsibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System provides a library of pre-built visualization types (heat maps, risk matrices, bar charts, line charts, radar charts, tree maps)
- Users can create customized dashboards with multiple visualization widgets
- Visualizations support drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis
- Dashboard configurations can be saved, shared, and exported
- System provides role-based dashboard views (executive, technical, compliance)
- Risk trend data is visualized over configurable time periods
- Users can filter visualizations by various dimensions (asset type, business function, risk level, etc.)
- Visualization components are responsive and performant across devices
- Reports can be generated from dashboard views
