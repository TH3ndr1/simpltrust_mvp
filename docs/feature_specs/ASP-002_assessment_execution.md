# Feature Specification: ASP-002 - Assessment Execution

## Overview
The Assessment Execution feature allows organizations to conduct structured assessments using predefined templates to evaluate their compliance posture against various frameworks and requirements. This feature enables users to instantiate assessment templates, assign responsibilities, collect responses and evidence, track progress, and finalize assessments. By providing a systematic process for executing assessments, the platform helps organizations move from ad-hoc compliance activities to a structured, repeatable approach that yields consistent and comparable results. The assessment execution process serves as the foundation for identifying gaps, managing remediation, and demonstrating continuous compliance improvement.

## Affected Components
- **Backend:**
  - Assessment instantiation service
  - Response collection service
  - Evidence management service
  - Progress tracking service
  - Workflow management service
  - Scoring and calculation engine
  - API endpoints for assessment execution
- **Frontend:**
  - Assessment overview interface
  - Question response forms
  - Evidence upload interface
  - Progress tracking dashboard
  - Reviewer interface
  - Collaboration tools
  - Assessment report viewer

## Technical Dependencies
- Assessment Templates (ASP-001)
- Control Framework Model (UCF-001)
- Asset Inventory (ASM-001) for asset-specific assessments
- Asset-Control Mapping (ASM-004) for control references

## User Stories
- As a Compliance Manager, I want to initiate assessments from templates so that I can systematically evaluate our compliance posture.
- As an Assessor, I want to respond to assessment questions and upload supporting evidence so that I can document our compliance status.
- As a Control Owner, I want to be notified when assessments require my input so that I can provide timely responses about controls I manage.
- As a Reviewer, I want to review assessment responses and evidence so that I can validate the accuracy of compliance claims.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to track assessment progress so that I can ensure assessments are completed on schedule.
- As an Auditor, I want to generate assessment reports so that I can document compliance status for regulatory purposes.
- As a Department Head, I want to delegate assessment questions to team members so that subject matter experts can provide accurate responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System allows instantiation of assessment templates with configurable parameters
- Users can assign questions to individuals or roles for response
- System supports various response types matching question types (text, multiple choice, yes/no, numeric, etc.)
- Users can upload, manage, and link evidence files to responses
- System provides a workflow for response, review, and approval
- Assessment progress is tracked and visualized
- Users can add comments and notes to responses
- System calculates scores based on template scoring methodology
- Assessments can be saved as drafts and resumed later
- System supports bulk operations for similar responses
- Final assessment reports can be generated in various formats
- Assessment history is maintained for audit purposes
- System provides collaboration tools for assessment participants

## Integration Points
