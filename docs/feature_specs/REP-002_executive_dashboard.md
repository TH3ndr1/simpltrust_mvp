# Feature Specification: REP-002 Executive Dashboard

## Overview

The Executive Dashboard provides a high-level, strategic view of an organization's security and compliance posture, designed specifically for executive leadership and board members. This feature transforms complex security and compliance data into clear, actionable insights through intuitive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) that enable informed decision-making at the highest levels of an organization.

The dashboard presents a comprehensive yet distilled view of critical security metrics, compliance status, risk trends, and implementation progress. It emphasizes strategic information over technical details, focusing on business impact, resource allocation efficiency, regulatory compliance status, and overall security program effectiveness. The interface is designed for clarity and impact, allowing executives with limited technical background to quickly understand the organization's security and compliance standing.

With customizable views, drill-down capabilities, and time-based comparisons, the Executive Dashboard bridges the communication gap between technical security professionals and executive leadership, enabling data-driven governance and strategic planning of security and compliance initiatives.
