Summary
“Imagine an intuitive compliance platform built specifically for SMEs that need to meet cybersecurity and regulatory demands but don’t have dedicated compliance teams. Our platform simplifies compliance management by guiding users step-by-step, ensuring they understand not only what they need to do but also why it matters for their business.”

	•	Organizational Scoping
	•	Start with Organizational Scoping, where users define their compliance landscape through a plain-language questionnaire and industry based templates. The platform helps users identify relevant regulations and map them to their unique business functions.
	•	This step also generates a business capability map, linking compliance requirements directly to critical functions, which helps users see the connection between compliance and business value. 
	•	Unified Control Framework
	•	We then build a Unified Control Framework by mapping regulatory requirements and any internal policies to industry standards like ISO 27001 or NIST. This unified approach simplifies managing multiple regulations under one structure.
	•	With drag-and-drop tools and templates, users can easily create practical controls and remove redundant work by identifying overlapping requirements. 
	•	Asset Management
	•	With controls in place, we move to Asset Management, where users build an inventory of business objects (data, systems, process, teams, physical devices,..) categorized by type and importance.
	•	This inventory links assets to relevant business capabilities, helping users track ownership and responsibilities. Integrations with automated discovery tools keep this list updated without manual effort. 
	•	Assessment Planning
	•	Next, we plan assessments with Assessment Planning. Users schedule periodic checks and audits to ensure controls are working as intended. With calendar integration, reminders, and templates, assessments are easy to manage.
	•	This planning is tailored to asset criticality and risk levels, ensuring resources are directed where they’re needed most. 
	•	Assessment Execution
	•	In Assessment Execution, users conduct assessments with the help of checklists and templates, evaluating each control for compliance. Evidence collection can be manual or automated for a streamlined process.
	•	This step ensures thorough evaluation of each control and creates an organized record of compliance actions. 
	•	Gap Analysis & Reporting
	•	After assessments, the platform performs a Gap Analysis to identify areas needing improvement, with gaps color-coded by criticality.
	•	Each gap comes with actionable recommendations tailored to the criticality of the affected assets. This guidance enables users to focus on high-impact improvements without requiring specialized knowledge.   
	•	Risk Assessment
	•	In the Risk Assessment phase, the platform evaluates each gap’s impact on critical assets, helping users prioritize resources for high-impact areas.
	•	By focusing on risk in business-critical areas, this step helps users allocate resources effectively, reducing risks with the most significant impact on the organization. 
	•	Action and Resource Planning
	•	For each identified gap, the platform translates regulatory requirements into actionable tasks with clear language and provides AI-powered recommendations for resource allocation.
	•	Users can view tasks based on priority and dependencies, helping them manage timelines and adapt plans as compliance needs change. 
	•	Implementation Tracking
	•	The platform provides Implementation Tracking to monitor each action item’s progress, focusing on quick wins and high-priority items first.
	•	Visual tools, like Gantt charts or progress bars, allow users to see at a glance which actions are complete, in progress, or pending, helping them stay organized and on track. 
	•	Evidence Collection
	•	With Evidence Collection, the platform organizes all documentation proving compliance. Users can store and retrieve evidence by gap, asset, or compliance requirement, ensuring quick access during audits.
	•	Automated logging and secure storage make it easy to maintain a detailed audit trail, showing regulators a clear history of compliance actions. 
	•	Training and Awareness
	•	Training and Awareness programs are essential for compliance, so our platform provides role-based training sessions and e-learning modules to raise awareness.
	•	Progress tracking and comprehension scores help users measure training effectiveness, ensuring that all employees are aware of compliance requirements and best practices. 
	•	Continuous Monitoring
	•	With Continuous Monitoring, users track key compliance and risk metrics in real-time. Dashboards display alerts for any deviations, helping users stay on top of compliance status.
	•	AI-powered anomaly detection notifies users of potential issues immediately, reducing response times and strengthening the organization’s security posture. 
	•	Effectiveness Evaluation
	•	The Effectiveness Evaluation tool measures the impact of implemented controls on risk posture. It reviews feedback from users and analyzes the effect of actions on overall security and compliance, identifying any gaps in control effectiveness.
	•	This continuous feedback loop enables users to make informed improvements to their compliance strategy. 
	•	Strategic Review and Improvement
	•	In the Strategic Review and Improvement phase, users align compliance activities with broader business goals. This step allows users to adjust priorities based on organizational needs, assessing how security and compliance support business functions and identifying areas needing more investment.
	•	This long-term perspective enables the organization to use compliance as a competitive advantage, protecting operations while supporting growth. 
	•	Regulatory Update
	•	Based on the outcome of the strategic review, it is possible that the regulatory needs are to be updated (e.g. entering new customer segments require additional regulatory compliance). Changes to the company’s unified control framework are pushed accordingly.
	•	The platform’s Regulatory Update feature monitors changes in relevant regulations, alerting users to any new requirements that impact their compliance framework.
	•	With automatic updates and summaries, users stay informed about regulatory changes without needing to monitor updates themselves, ensuring ongoing alignment with legal requirements.

	•	Define the organization's regulatory landscape using pre-populated, industry-specific templates.
	•	Identify applicable best practice models and standards.
	•	Create  business capabilities map based on best practice models and industry standards.

	•	Categorize assets based on type, importance, and sensitivity.
	•	Map assets to related business capabilities.

	•	Reference Model Creation
	•	Build a unified control framework for your organization by translating all your regulatory requirements and cybersecurity expectations to control frameworks like ISO27K and NIST.
	•	Use pre populated templates or drag-and-drop tools to map regulatory requirements and expectations to control frameworks like ISO27k and NIST.
	•	Link actions to the control frameworks; the actions can be context specific (e.g. privacy check on Microsoft is much lighter than Alibaba, e.g. priorities for international vs local customer base requires different actions on the level of CRM related assets). Idea is to link the action variations to strategic drivers (e.g. international growth, M&A, etc…)
	•	Develop a unified control framework tailored to your organization.
