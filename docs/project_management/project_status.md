### MVP Technical Architecture

We have defined a lean, efficient technical architecture for the SimpleTrust MVP:

1. **Simplified MVP Approach**
   - Next.js application with Supabase backend
   - Serverless architecture for minimal infrastructure management
   - Focus on rapid delivery and user validation

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Supabase (authentication, database, storage)
   - AI Integration: OpenAI API for recommendation engine
   - Hosting: Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend services

3. **Data Architecture**
   - PostgreSQL database provided by Supabase
   - Row-level security for data isolation
   - Simplified schema focusing on core entities

4. **Security Architecture**
   - Supabase Auth for user authentication
   - JWT-based access control
   - TLS encryption for data in transit
   - Data encryption at rest

5. **Development Workflow**
   - GitHub for version control
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Vercel for automated deployments

### Development Planning

We have established a clear path forward through the kanban board and epics:

1. **Agile Approach**
   - Value-driven development prioritizing key differentiators
   - Six sprints to MVP completion
   - Regular validation points for testing assumptions

2. **Team Coordination**
   - Clear tasks and dependencies mapped out
   - Quality assurance approach defined
   - Success metrics established

3. **Sprint Planning**
   - Detailed planning for Sprint 1
   - High-level planning for subsequent sprints
   - Clear dependencies and critical path identified

## Value Proposition

The SimpleTrust platform will provide significant value to organizations by:

1. **Reducing Compliance Complexity**
   - Unified control framework eliminates redundant work
   - AI-powered guidance reduces expertise requirements
   - Business-centric approach provides contextual relevance

2. **Improving Efficiency**
   - Automated gap identification and remediation planning
   - Streamlined assessment and evidence collection
   - Intelligent task prioritization and management

3. **Enhancing Visibility**
   - Comprehensive dashboards and reporting
   - Real-time compliance status monitoring
   - Executive-level insights for decision making

4. **Enabling Continuous Compliance**
   - Shift from point-in-time to ongoing compliance
   - Automated monitoring and verification
   - Proactive identification of compliance drift

## Next Steps

## Conclusion

The SimpleTrust project has successfully completed its design phase with a comprehensive set of feature specifications, a lean technical architecture optimized for MVP delivery, and a clear development plan using our kanban board.

The technical architecture leverages Supabase to provide a powerful yet simplified backend, allowing the team to focus on delivering business value quickly rather than managing complex infrastructure. By embracing a serverless approach with Next.js and Vercel, we can achieve rapid development cycles and continuous deployment.

The next phase of the project will focus on implementing the core platform and beginning to validate our key differentiators with real users. By following our established kanban process and focusing on our epics, we will be able to efficiently build a high-quality MVP that meets the needs of organizations struggling with complex compliance requirements.
