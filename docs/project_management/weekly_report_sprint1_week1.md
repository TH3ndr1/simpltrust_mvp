  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure proper data access control
  - Added triggers for automatic timestamp updates on records
  - Created seed data for testing purposes
  - Configured TypeScript type definitions for database schema
  - Developed a setup script (`setup-supabase.sh`) to automate the local environment initialization
  - Updated package.json with Supabase-related scripts
  - Created comprehensive documentation in README.md

### INFRA-001-000: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript (Epic: E00)

2. Complete the design wireframes and establish the design system
3. Begin work on the organizational scoping module

## Additional Notes
- All team members should run the new Supabase setup script to ensure consistent local development environments
- The database schema is now ready for the implementation of the user authentication system
