# SimpleTrust Wireframe Plan (UX-001-000)

## Overview

This document outlines the wireframing approach for the SimpleTrust platform as part of UX-001-000. These wireframes will establish the foundation for the user interface components, layout structures, and interaction patterns to be used throughout the platform.

## Key Screens to Wireframe

Based on the UX requirements and feature specification documents, we'll focus on the following key screens:

1. **Role Selection / Landing Page**
   - Welcome screen with role selection
   - Introduction to key GRC functionalities
   - Quick start buttons

2. **Advanced Dashboard (Home Screen)**
   - Navigation bar
   - Main dashboard panel with widgets
   - Side panel for alerts and notifications
   - Quick action bar

3. **Guided Workflow Screen**
   - Progress tracker
   - Central content panel
   - Navigation buttons
   - Contextual help panel

4. **Evidence Management Screen**
   - Evidence list
   - Evidence detail view
   - Upload interface

5. **Controls & Policies Screen**
   - Tabbed view for Controls and Policies
   - List views for each
   - Detail view for individual items

6. **Risk Management Details Screen**
   - Risk list with indicators
   - Detailed risk view
   - Interactive charts
   - Linkage to assessments and tasks

7. **Notifications & Alerts Screen**
   - Notification list with timestamps
   - Filter options
   - Detail view

8. **Settings & Configuration Screen**
   - Navigation tabs
   - Form fields and toggles
   - Save/Cancel buttons

## Design System Elements to Define

1. **Color System**
   - Primary: #2563EB (Blue)
   - Secondary: #0F172A (Dark Blue)
   - Accent: #7C3AED (Purple)
   - Success: #10B981 (Green)
   - Warning: #F59E0B (Amber)
   - Error: #EF4444 (Red)
   - Info: #3B82F6 (Light Blue)
   - Neutrals: Gray scale from #F9FAFB to #111827

2. **Typography**
   - Heading styles (h1-h6)
   - Body text styles
   - Caption and label styles
   - Code and monospace styles

3. **Layout Components**
   - Grid system
   - Container types
   - Spacing scale
   - Responsive breakpoints

4. **UI Components**
   - Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost, etc.)
   - Form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc.)
   - Cards and containers
   - Navigation elements
   - Tables and data displays
   - Alerts and notifications
   - Modal and dialog designs

## Wireframing Approach

1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**:
   - Create basic layout structures for each screen
   - Define content hierarchy and information architecture
   - Establish key interaction points
   - Review with stakeholders for functional requirements

2. **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes**:
   - Add more detailed UI components
   - Establish responsive behaviors
   - Define state changes (hover, active, disabled)
   - Include basic typography and spacing

3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**:
   - Apply complete visual design language
   - Implement color system
   - Finalize typography and spacing
   - Prepare for developer handoff

## Accessibility Considerations

- All designs will follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Color contrast ratios will be validated
- Interactive elements will have clear focus states
- Touch targets will be minimum 44x44px
- Alternative text strategies will be defined
- Keyboard navigation paths will be planned

## Next Steps

1. Create low-fidelity wireframes for the key screens
2. Develop the core component library in code
3. Build a living style guide/design system documentation
4. Implement the design in the frontend codebase
