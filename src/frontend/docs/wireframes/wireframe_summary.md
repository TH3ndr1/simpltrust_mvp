# SimpleTrust Wireframe Summary (UX-001-000)

## Completed Wireframes

We have successfully created low-fidelity wireframes for the following key screens:

1. **Dashboard**: Main operational hub showing compliance status, risk scores, recent activities, and framework compliance metrics.

2. **Guided Workflow**: Interactive process wizard for completing assessments and other GRC activities with progress tracking.

3. **Evidence Management**: Repository for managing compliance evidence with filtering, detailed views, and approval workflows.

4. **Controls & Policies**: Library for managing controls, policies, and other governance documentation with framework mapping.

## Design System Implementation Plan

To move from wireframes to implementation, we recommend the following approach:

### Phase 1: Core Component Library Setup (1-2 weeks)
1. Set up Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration for colors, spacing, etc.
2. Implement basic typography system (headings, body text, specialized text)
3. Create base UI components:
   - Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost, etc.)
   - Form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc.)
   - Cards, panels, and containers
   - Navigation elements (tabs, breadcrumbs, etc.)
   - Table and data display components
   - Notification and status indicators

### Phase 2: Layout Framework Development (1 week)
1. Create responsive grid system and layouts
2. Implement main navigation structure
3. Develop sidebar components for different contexts
4. Build panel systems for the dashboard widgets
5. Create adaptive containers for different screen sizes

### Phase 3: Interactive Component Development (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
2. Create chart and visualization components
3. Build form wizard components for guided workflows
4. Develop modal and dialog systems
5. Implement drag-and-drop interfaces

### Phase 4: Screen Implementation (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement Dashboard with widget components
2. Build Guided Workflow system with step tracking
3. Create Evidence Management screen with filtering and details view
4. Implement Controls & Policies interface with tabbed navigation

### Phase 5: Integration and Refinement (1-2 weeks)
1. Connect components to backend API endpoints
2. Implement state management and data flow
3. Add loading states and error handling
4. Conduct accessibility review and fixes
5. Optimize performance for all screen sizes

## Technology Stack Recommendations

Based on the wireframes and project requirements, we recommend the following technology stack for implementation:

1. **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
3. **Component Library**: Build custom components on top of shadcn/ui or Radix UI
4. **Data Visualization**: Recharts for charts and data visualization
5. **Data Tables**: TanStack Table (React Table) for advanced table features
6. **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod for validation
7. **State Management**: React Context + SWR for data fetching and caching
8. **Authentication**: Next Auth integrated with Supabase Auth

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize wireframes with stakeholders
2. Create detailed component specifications for the design system
3. Set up core Next.js project structure with Tailwind configuration
4. Begin implementation of the base component library
5. Create high-fidelity mockups for key screens to refine visual design

## Accessibility Considerations

The implementation will follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including:

- Sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with ARIA attributes
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Responsive design for different devices and screen readers
- Clear error messaging and form validation
- Support for text scaling up to 200%

## Performance Targets

- Initial load under 2 seconds on broadband connections
- Time to interactive under 3.5 seconds
- Lighthouse Performance score > 90
- Core Web Vitals passing thresholds
- Smooth transitions and animations (60fps)
- Optimized for mobile data connections
