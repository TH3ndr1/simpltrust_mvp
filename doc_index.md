# SimplTrust Documentation

Welcome to the SimplTrust documentation. This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the SimplTrust platform, including product requirements, feature specifications, agile development roadmap, and project management artifacts.

## Overview

SimplTrust is an AI-driven compliance and cybersecurity platform designed specifically for SMEs. It simplifies complex regulatory and risk management challenges through guided workflows, automated gap analysis, and continuous monitoring. The platform follows lean startup principles with a focus on validating key differentiators early while building only the minimal necessary supporting functionality.

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI-Powered Guidance**: Converting complex compliance requirements into actionable tasks with minimal human expertise
2. **Unified Compliance Framework**: Eliminating redundant work across multiple regulatory frameworks
3. **Business-Centric Approach**: Linking compliance to business capabilities and assets for contextual relevance

## Value-Driven Development Approach

SimplTrust follows lean startup principles to ensure we're building the right features at the right time:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Hypothesis[Form Value Hypothesis] --> Build[Build Minimum Feature Set]
    Build --> Measure[Measure User Engagement]
    Measure --> Learn[Learn & Validate]
    Learn --> Adjust[Adjust Hypothesis]
    Adjust --> Build
    
    subgraph "Key Differentiators"
    AI[AI-Powered Guidance]
    UCF[Unified Compliance Framework]
    Business[Business-Centric Approach]
    end
```

Our development approach focuses on:

1. **Validating key differentiators early**: Building and testing the most unique and valuable features first
2. **Incremental feature delivery**: Implementing minimal versions of features early, then enhancing based on feedback
3. **Learning-focused development**: Structuring work to maximize validated learning about user needs

## Epic Structure

The platform development is organized around 8 epics that represent major value streams:

    E01[E01: Compliance Landscape Definition] --> E02[E02: Unified Framework]
    E01 --> E03[E03: Asset Risk Management]
    E02 --> E04[E04: Assessment & Gap Analysis]
    E03 --> E04
    E04 --> E05[E05: AI-Powered Action Planning]
    E04 --> E06[E06: Documentation & Evidence]
    E05 --> E07[E07: Continuous Compliance]
    E06 --> E07

    E08 --> E06
    E04 --> REP[Reporting]

    E07 --> REP
```

## Development Timeline

The MVP development is planned over 6 two-week sprints (12 weeks total), focused on validating key differentiators:
